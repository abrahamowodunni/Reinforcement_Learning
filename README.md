# Reinforcement Learning Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my journey into **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**â€”a fascinating branch of machine learning that involves training agents to make sequential decisions and maximize rewards. As I learn more about key RL concepts, algorithms, and applications, I'll be updating this repository with summaries and code implementations.

## ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

This is a **work in progress** as I deepen my understanding of reinforcement learning fundamentals and explore practical implementations.

## Current Focus
- Understanding **Markov Decision Processes (MDP)** and **Policies** (deterministic and stochastic).
- Studying **Value Functions** and how they guide the agent's decisions.
- Exploring **Monte Carlo** methods and **Temporal Difference (TD)** learning for policy evaluation and improvement.

## Topics Covered

- **Sequential Decision-Making**: Training agents to make a sequence of decisions that maximize long-term rewards.
- **Policies**: Determining actions based on current states, both deterministically and stochastically.
- **Value Function**: Calculating the long-term reward of states to guide better decisions.
- **Model-Based vs. Model-Free RL**: Distinguishing between agents that rely on an internal model of the environment and those that learn directly from interactions.
- **Markov Chains and MDPs**: Modeling state transitions and reward processes with Markov properties.
- **Monte Carlo Methods**: Evaluating policies by averaging rewards, with **every-visit** and **first-visit** variations.
- **Temporal Difference Learning**: Combining Monte Carlo and dynamic programming to evaluate and improve policies.

## Future Work

- Implement and visualize more advanced topics like **Q-Learning**, **SARSA**, and **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**.
- Explore **Policy Gradient Methods** and how they relate to LLM applications.
- Experiment with **attention mechanisms** in RL to improve learning in complex, sequential decision tasks.

Stay tuned as I refine and expand this repository with more insights and examples!
